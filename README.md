# Building an MCP Server with OCR: From Setup Struggles to Document Intelligence

*A real-world journey of setting up Anthropic's Model Context Protocol server with advanced PDF processing capabilities*

## The Challenge: Making Claude Desktop Read Your Documents

Ever wished your AI assistant could read through your scanned PDFs, legal documents, or HOA covenants without you having to manually extract text? That's exactly what we set out to accomplish in this session - building a custom MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that not only reads PDFs but intelligently handles scanned documents using OCR.

## Starting Point: Following the Official Tutorial

We began by following Anthropic's official MCP server tutorial to build a basic weather server. What seemed like a straightforward process quickly became a Windows-specific debugging adventure.

### The Setup Struggles

**Problem #1: Missing Configuration File**
The first hurdle was the infamous "cannot find claude_desktop_config.json" error. This configuration file doesn't exist by default - you need to create it manually in the right location:
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**Problem #2: UV Package Manager Permissions**
The tutorial requires `uv` (a fast Python package manager), but our initial installation had permission issues. The solution was using PowerShell as Administrator with the bypass flag:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**Problem #3: Project Scripts Configuration**
Even with `uv` working, the server couldn't run because the `pyproject.toml` was missing the crucial `[project.scripts]` section:
```toml
[project.scripts]
weather = "weather:main"
```

## Building the Weather Server Foundation

Once we overcame the setup issues, we had a basic weather server running with these tools:
- `get_forecast` - Simulated weather forecasts for any city
- `get_alerts` - Weather alerts for US states

The server successfully connected to Claude Desktop, proving our MCP infrastructure was working.

## The Real Goal: Document Intelligence

With the foundation in place, we tackled the main objective - adding PDF reading capabilities with OCR support for scanned documents. This required several components:

### 1. Basic PDF Reading
Using `PyPDF2` for extractable text PDFs:
```python
def extract_pdf_text(file_path: str, page_numbers: list[int] = None):
    # Extract text from regular PDFs
```

### 2. OCR Integration
For scanned documents, we integrated:
- **pytesseract** - Python wrapper for Google's Tesseract OCR engine  
- **pdf2image** - Converts PDF pages to images for OCR processing
- **Pillow** - Image processing library

### 3. Intelligent Detection System
The server automatically determines whether a PDF needs OCR:
```python
def has_extractable_text(file_path: str) -> bool:
    # Checks if PDF has meaningful extractable text
    # Falls back to OCR for scanned documents
```

### 4. Caching System
Perhaps the most valuable feature - OCR results are cached to avoid reprocessing:
- Cached files use naming pattern: `document_ocr_[hash].txt`
- Hash ensures cache invalidation when source PDF changes
- Dramatically improves performance for repeat access

## Security Considerations

The server includes built-in security measures:
- **Path Validation**: Only allows access to predefined directories
- **File Type Restrictions**: Limited to PDF files
- **Permission Checks**: Validates file access before processing

```python
ALLOWED_PDF_DIRECTORIES = [
    "/path/to/your/documents",
    "/path/to/your/pdfs", 
    "/path/to/your/downloads"
]
```

## Real-World Test: HOA Document Analysis

To validate our system, we processed actual HOA covenant documents:
- **Input**: 5.1 MB scanned PDF with 40+ pages
- **Processing**: Full OCR extraction and caching
- **Output**: Complete one-page summary of key provisions
- **Result**: Instant future access via cached text

The system successfully identified property restrictions, assessment procedures, architectural controls, and enforcement mechanisms from a complex legal document.

## Final MCP Tools Arsenal

Our completed server provides these capabilities:

**Document Tools:**
- `read_pdf` - Read entire documents or specific pages with automatic OCR
- `list_pdfs` - Inventory available documents with scan/cache status
- `search_pdf_content` - Full-text search within documents

**Weather Tools:**
- `get_forecast` - Weather forecasts for any location
- `get_alerts` - Weather alerts by state

**Smart Features:**
- Automatic scanned PDF detection
- Intelligent OCR fallback
- Persistent caching system
- Security-first file access

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Windows Development Gotchas
- PowerShell execution policies can block installations
- Path separators matter in configuration files
- Permission issues are common with package managers

### 2. OCR Implementation Insights
- System dependencies (Tesseract, Poppler) are required
- Caching is essential for practical OCR performance
- Hybrid approach (text extraction + OCR fallback) works best

### 3. MCP Architecture Benefits
- Modular tool design allows easy capability expansion
- Security model provides controlled file system access
- Integration with Claude Desktop creates seamless user experience

## Performance Impact

The caching system provides dramatic performance improvements:
- **First Access**: ~30-60 seconds for OCR processing
- **Subsequent Access**: <1 second from cache
- **Storage Overhead**: ~10-20% of original PDF size for text cache

## What's Next?

This foundation opens up numerous possibilities:
- Integration with cloud OCR services for better accuracy
- Support for additional document formats (DOCX, images)
- Semantic search using embeddings
- Document comparison and analysis tools
- Automated summarization and extraction pipelines

## Code Availability

The complete MCP server code includes:
- Comprehensive error handling
- Type hints throughout
- Detailed documentation
- Production-ready security measures
- Extensible architecture for additional tools

## Conclusion

Building this MCP server transformed a basic tutorial into a powerful document intelligence system. What started as debugging configuration issues evolved into a practical tool for extracting insights from scanned legal documents.

The real value isn't just in the technical implementation - it's in democratizing access to document analysis. Now anyone can ask their AI assistant to "summarize my HOA covenants" or "what are the key restrictions in my lease?" and get instant, accurate responses from scanned PDFs.

The journey from setup struggles to document intelligence showcases both the power of the MCP architecture and the practical challenges of real-world AI development. Sometimes the best learning happens when things don't work as expected.
